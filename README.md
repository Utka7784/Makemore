# 🧠 Makemore — Character-Level Language Model (From Scratch)

> Implementation of a **character-level language model** from scratch in pure Python and PyTorch, following [Andrej Karpathy’s "Makemore"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaCmpygFfXo) from the **Neural Networks: Zero to Hero** series.

---

## Overview

This project builds a **mini GPT-style model** capable of learning to generate names (or text) one character at a time.  
It demonstrates how a neural network can be trained to predict the next character in a sequence — forming the foundation of how **Large Language Models (LLMs)** work internally.

I implemented and experimented with this entirely in **Jupyter Notebook** to understand every component — data processing, embeddings, feed-forward layers, and loss optimization — all built step-by-step.
